## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an advanced algorithm and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on key health parameters. The initiative is grounded on the guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health, utilizing a risk prediction chart that considers six critical factors: age, gender, diabetic status, smoking status, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Key Features:
### Algorithm Development:
- The algorithm is designed to accurately predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases by integrating the specified health parameters.
- When the blood pressure detector is connected in auto mode, blood pressure can be detected automatically.
- It employs a robust computational model that processes the input data and outputs the risk level, aiding healthcare providers and individuals in making informed decisions.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI):
- The GUI is developed to ensure ease of use, enabling users to input their health data effortlessly.
- When the auto mode is executed, real-time blood pressure readings are plotted.
- It visually presents the risk assessment results, making the information accessible and understandable to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

### Data Parameters:
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Diabetic Status
4. Smoking Status
5. Blood Pressure
6. Cholesterol Level

### Data Saving Option:
The system offers an optional feature to save the entered data and risk assessment results.

## Impact and Benefits:

- __For Healthcare Providers:__ The system serves as a valuable tool for early detection and preventive care, allowing for timely interventions and personalized patient care plans.
- __For Individuals:__ Empowers users with insights into their cardiovascular health, encouraging proactive health management and lifestyle modifications to mitigate risk.
